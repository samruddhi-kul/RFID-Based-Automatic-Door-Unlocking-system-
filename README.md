# RFID-Based-Automatic-Door-Unlocking-system-
In this RFID based automatic door unlocking system Project using Arduino We Connect servo motors to the door on one sides of the door . Write code to control the servo motors to open and close the door . Because of  this automatically door are closed and open and this is more secure for  used and also to control the theft . 
In this technology we used two tags where one tag is valid and other will be invalid so this technology one drawback 
it will be when valid tag will lose then we can not open the door so for these condition we implement in these technology â€“
We attach a emergency button this button only known to user  we can use this button when tag will be lose.
